# Shopware Refresh Cart Amount

When there are items in the cart and the store front is visited for the next time, the cart amount shown is zero (0,00). This plugin refreshes the amount on each visit.

## Installation

Copy the plugin folder (not `Frontend`) to `/engine/Shopware/Plugins/Community/Frontend` and activate the plugin in Shopware's plugin management.
